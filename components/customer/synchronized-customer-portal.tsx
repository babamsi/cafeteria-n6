## Key Synchronization Features:

1. **Unit Conversion System**: Customers see appropriate serving sizes (portions, pieces, cups)
while inventory tracks in bulk
units(kg, liters)

2 ** Real - time
Sync**
: All modules update instantly when changes occur in any part of the system

3. **Proper Flow**:
   - Kitchen prepares items → Available in POS & Customer Portal
   - POS/Customer orders → Kitchen receives preparation requests
   - Inventory automatically deducts based on actual consumption

4. **Customer-Friendly Units**:
   - Rice: "1 cup" instead of "0.2 kg"
   - Chicken: "1 piece" instead of "0.15 kg"
   - Beverages: "1 glass" instead of "0.25 L"

5. **Accurate Inventory Tracking**: Backend maintains precise measurements
for cost calculation and stock
management

system
ensures
customers

see
confusing
bulk
measurements
while maintaining accurate
business
operations
behind
the
scenes.
